# qlib

A simple Python library for quantum mechanics simulations. Features include standard operator, bra, and ket manipulation, easy-to-use visualization tools, and frequently used Hamiltonians built in. Currently, in an effort to improve computational efficiency, time evolution is offloaded
to Mathematica, although this will likely be changed in the future to increase accessibility. All expressions are nondimensionalized. 

## Basic Syntax

The core objects in the library are the following:
1. oper
2. bra
3. ket
They are constructed given an array (2d for opers) as input, and they can be combined with the standard arithmetic operators. For example, the following code

```
excitation = ket([1, 0])
null_state = ket([0, 0])
pauli_minus_op = pauli_m()
qprint(pauli_minus_op)
qprint(pauli_minus_op * (excitation + null_state))
```

Prints the following result to terminal
```
[[0.000+0.000j, 0.000+0.000j];
 [1.000+0.000j, 0.000+0.000j]]
[0.000+0.000j; 1.000+0.000j]
```

Tensor/Kronecker products are perfomed with the 'tensor' function:
```
excitation = ket([1, 0])
double_excitation = tensor(excitation, excitation)
qprint(double_excitation)
```
The output:
```
[1.000+0.000j; 0.000+0.000j; 0.000+0.000j; 0.000+0.000j]
```

## Time Propagation
Time propagation of a state given a Hamiltonian and a single time t is calculated via the time evolution operator (matrix exponential). Support for time-dependent Hamiltonians will be added soon. For propagation over a time range, two methods are available: repeated usage of the time evolution operator and numerical integration. For example, to evolve an excited state to some arbitrary time according to the Pauli Z matrix, we could write
```
t = 10
psi0 = state(2, 0)
psif = time_evolve(pauli_z(), t, psi0)
qprint(psif)
```
This yields the result:
```
[-0.839+0.544j; 0.000+0.000j]
```

## Visualization Support
Currently, the main visualization tools are expectation value plots and energy schema. Sample usage of both can be found in the 'examples' directory. Attached is a sample expectation value plot for the Jaynes-Cummings model:
