# qlib

A super simple Python library for simulating quantum mechanics. Features include standard operator, bra, and ket manipulation, easy-to-use visualization tools, and frequently used Hamiltonians built in. Currently, in an effort to improve computational efficiency, time evolution is offloaded
to Mathematica, although this will likely be changed in the future to increase accessibility. 

For sample usage, reference the 'examples' directory.
